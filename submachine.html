        <li>Polish artist <a href="http://www.mateuszskutnik.com/">Mateusz Skutnik</a> is the creator of Submachine and a few other games (Daymare Town, Covert Front, Slice of Sea, etc), all of which have been dear to me since I was a child.</li>
        <li>They are browser games, with high-res executables made available for sale later.</li>
        <li>The games' <b>main points of interest </b>are:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The signature atmospheric <a href="./artstyle.html">artstyle</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEgQGE1TPGo">music</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The labyrinth - a world with hundreds of rooms, full of machines and mechanisms that need to be solved in order to reach the end room, which is the entrance to yet another labyrinth
                </li>

            </ul>
        <li>In Submachine, the setting is sci-fi, with the mechanisms going from simple gears and levers to space warpers and teleportators. </li>
        <li>Originally built by humans, the infrastructure of the Submachine started growing itself and has become impossibly large. </li>
        <li>You play as a silent protagonist and are trying to escape it.</li>
    </ul>
